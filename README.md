## Predicting Bounding Boxes using transfer learning:

Define Network (creation of the final model to train it)

Train the Model

 Evaluate performance using IoU : You can see how well your model predicts bounding boxes on the validation set by calculating the Intersection-over-union (IoU) score for each image.
